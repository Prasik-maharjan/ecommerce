                <p className="text-sm py-3">Ecomus was founded in 1995 by Jane Smith, a fashion lover with a passion for timeless style. Jane had always been drawn to classic pieces that could be worn season after season, and she believed that there was a gap in the market for a store that focused solely on classic women's clothing. She opened the first store in a small town in New England, where it quickly became a local favorite.</p>
